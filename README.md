# CaroGame
The game still contains bugs. Since the structure of the code is not optimized, it is really hard for me to fix those bugs.
Plus the fact that I do not proud of everything I had made for the game, I decided to drop this project.

Nevertheless, the normal flow of the game still works as normal. 

Caro is a small game that allows two players play over the network. Each player should join the Caro game room with a name. After joining the room, a player can invite the other to play with. The inviting can give a preferred board size (NxN). The invited player should accept the inviting. At the first time, the game will randomly choose who is the X -player right after the invited accepts the inviting. When a game finished, a new game is started with the X-player is set to the player who was O-player in the previous game.
