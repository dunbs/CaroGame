# CaroGame
The game still has bugs. Since the structure of the code is not optimize, it is really hard for me to fix those bugs.
Plus the fact that I do not proud of everything I had made for the game, I decided to drop this project.

Nevertheless, the normal flow of the game still works as normal.
